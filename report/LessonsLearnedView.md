## Lessons learned

### 'It works on my machine'

* We have had plenty of issues in regards to getting everything to run on all of our machines. (Include screenshots from Slack?)
* It's difficult to help with limited resources and being forced to work apart at all times (Draw parallels to remote development IRL?)

### Servers are not black magic

* Once you grasp basic concepts (SSH, SCP, Linux, etc.) then it is easy to figure out how to get your code running on another machine.

## Reflection

Also reflect and describe what was the "DevOps" style of your work. For example, what did you do differently to previous development projects and how did it work?

* Never had a big focus on operations before
* CI/CD allows us, as developers, to almost forget about the operations aspect. It just works
* Focus on writing maintainable code
