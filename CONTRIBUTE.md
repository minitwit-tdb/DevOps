# How to contribute

## Repository setup

This project will use a monorepo to allow for easy code sharing between different projects.

## Branching model

Git flow should be used for this project. <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow>

## Distributed development workflow

We're using a Centralized Workflow.

## How should contributions look like?

Should be in form of a pull request to the ``develop branch``.

Furthermore all tests must pass, and the contribution must also be able to auto-merge into the branch.

## Responsibility for integrating/reviewing contributions

Generally we all have the responsibility to review contributions to this project.
In essence there is no single integrator, instead the task will be delegated based on developer availability.

However, there should always be at least one other maintainer to review contributions before they are merged to develop.
